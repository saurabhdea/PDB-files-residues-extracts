# PDB-files-residues-extracts
script processes PDB (Protein Data Bank) files and extracts information about unique residues (identified by chain, residue sequence, and residue name). It outputs a summary for each input PDB file, including the file name, the total number of unique residues, and a list of unique residue identifiers.

I've included one pdb file sample in the directory that you can modify on your own.
run <strong>BASH script.sh</strong> or <strong>BASH script.sh > output.txt</strong> to obtain resedues information.
